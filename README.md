The report titled "IoT Based Traffic Hazard Monitoring and Reduction System" presents a solution to manage urban traffic hazards using IoT technologies. This system incorporates sensors (e.g., MQ7 for carbon monoxide, MQ135 for gas, DHT11 for humidity/temperature, and a sound sensor) to monitor real-time data related to traffic hazards, including accidents, road blockages, and weather conditions.

The system processes data through an Arduino Uno and uses an ESP32 NodeMCU to transmit the data to a cloud server for centralized monitoring. Alerts are generated when thresholds are exceeded, such as high gas concentration or excessive noise, enabling real-time response and improved traffic safety. The system is tested in a laboratory environment, validating the accuracy and responsiveness of the sensors and overall system.

This IoT-based system aims to reduce traffic risks, enhance road safety, and promote environmental sustainability through real-time monitoring and adaptive hazard reduction.
